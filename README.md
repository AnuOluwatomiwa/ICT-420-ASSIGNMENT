An assignment, in my final year from Mr.Justin Unegbu
course ICT 420: Signal Processing fundamentals
to generate a table of values for A certain signal that is defined mathematically as f(t) = A-4AT(t)  for 0≤t≤T/2
                                                                                          = -3A+4AT(t)  for T/2≤t≤T
                                                                                          = 5A-4AT(t)  for T≤t≤3T/2
                                                                                          = -7A+4AT(t)  for 3T/2≤t≤2T

Using T = 10µ second and A=xy volts where xy represents the last 2 digits of your matriculation number, draw this signal by plotting a graph of f(t) against t from t=0 to t= 2T. 

You can draw manually on a graph paper in which case you must show your table of values, or you can draw with any programming language in which case you must include your printout and your source code. 

The source code and the printout must bear your name and matriculation number.
